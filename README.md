# Metro Atlanta Covid-19

I wanted a better visualization of local COVID-19 data than I've been able to 
find, particularly in terms of the distribution of cases and deaths
and how they're changing over time. Some charts in this project track confirmed 
cases and deaths in the core Metro Atlanta counties, both in absolute and 
relative terms. Other charts track new cases and deaths in Metro Atlanta, 
Georgia, and the United States.

The Shiny app allows users to examine Georgia data on a county by county level. Available at: https://jamesphare.shinyapps.io/Georgia_COVID-19_by_County/

All data come from the New York Times' ongoing [repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) of COVID-19 cases and
deaths in the United States.
