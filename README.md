# Metro Atlanta Covid-19

This project began as an attempt to create better visualizations of local COVID-19 data than were available at the time. 

The first product of this project is an [R Markdown document](https://github.com/jamesphare/metro_atlanta_covid/blob/master/Metro_Atlanta_COVID.md) focused on Metro Atlanta that visualizes the distribution of cases and deaths as they change over time. The charts in this document track new cases and deaths in the core Metro Atlanta counties, both in absolute and relative terms. The subsequent charts track new cases and deaths in Metro Atlanta, Georgia, and the United States.

The second product of this project is a [Shiny web app](https://jamesphare.shinyapps.io/COVID_by_county/), which visualizes new case and death data for the entire United States, with a focus on county-level data in the context of state and national data.

The third product of this project is [work in progress](https://github.com/jamesphare/metro_atlanta_covid/blob/master/DeKalb_by_Zip.md) exploring the relation between median income by zipcode and cases of COVID-19 in DeKalb County, Georgia.
